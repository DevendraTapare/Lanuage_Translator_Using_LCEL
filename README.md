# 🧠 Build a Simple LLM Application using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)

This project showcases a **Simple LLM (Large Language Model) Application** that translates English text into another language using **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**.  
It’s a compact yet powerful demonstration of how LLM applications are built, chained, debugged, and deployed — a great foundation for scalable AI systems.

## 🚀 Project Overview

I developed this project to demonstrate how **LangChain** can be used to build production-ready **LLM-powered applications** with minimal code.  
The app performs **text translation** using **prompt templates**, **output parsers**, and **LCEL** to connect components efficiently.

### 🧩 Key Highlights
- ✅ Built a fully functional **LLM translation pipeline** using **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**  
- 🧠 Implemented **PromptTemplate** and **OutputParser** for dynamic text processing  
- 🔗 Connected LLM components using **LCEL chaining**  
- 🪲 Integrated **LangSmith** for debugging and trace visualization  
- ☁️ Deployed the model pipeline with **LangServe** to make it accessible via an API

## 🧠 Learning Goals

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of:
- Using **language models** for text transformation tasks  
- Designing **prompt-driven pipelines** using LangChain  
- Applying **LCEL** to build modular and reusable AI workflows  
- Debugging and monitoring LLM behavior using **LangSmith**  
- Deploying LangChain applications using **LangServe**
